[LibriSpeech](http://www.danielpovey.com/files/2015_icassp_librispeech.pdf) is a large corpus of English-read speech, designed for training and evaluating models for ASR.  The dataset contains 1000 hours of speech derived from audiobooks.  We will work with a small subset in this project, since larger-scale data would take a long while to train.  However, after completing this project, if you are interested in exploring further, you are encouraged to work with more of the data that is provided [online](http://www.openslr.org/12/).\n",

    "In the code cells below, you will use the `vis_train_features` module to visualize a training example.  The supplied argument `index=0` tells the module to extract the first example in the training set.  (You are welcome to change `index=0` to point to a different training example, if you like, but please **DO NOT** amend any other code in the cell.)  The returned variables are:\n",
    "- `vis_text` - transcribed text (label) for the training example.\n",
    "- `vis_raw_audio` - raw audio waveform for the training example.\n",

    "- `vis_spectrogram_feature` - spectrogram for the training example. \n",

The added value of a bidirectional RNN is described well in [this paper](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton/absps/DRNN_speech.pdf).\n",

In speech recognition, where whole utterances are transcribed at once, there is no reason not to exploit future context as well.  Bidirectional RNNs (BRNNs) do this by processing the data in both directions with two separate hidden layers which are then fed forwards to the same output layer.\n",

It is **NOT** necessary to include new layer types that were not explored in the notebook.\n",

To add dropout to [recurrent layers](https://faroit.github.io/keras-docs/1.0.2/layers/recurrent/), pay special attention to the `dropout_W` and `dropout_U` arguments.  This [paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.05287) may also provide some interesting theoretical background.\n",
    "- If you choose to include a convolutional layer in your model, you may get better results by working with **dilated convolutions**.  If you choose to use dilated convolutions, make sure that you are able to accurately calculate the length of the acoustic model's output in the `model.output_length` lambda function.  You can read more about dilated convolutions in Google's [WaveNet paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03499).  For an example of a speech-to-text system that makes use of dilated convolutions, check out this GitHub [repository](https://github.com/buriburisuri/speech-to-text-wavenet).  You can work with dilated convolutions [in Keras](https://keras.io/layers/convolutional/) by paying special attention to the `padding` argument when you specify a convolutional layer.\n",
    "- If your model makes use of convolutional layers, why not also experiment with adding **max pooling**?  Check out [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.02720.pdf) for example architecture that makes use of max pooling in an acoustic model.\n",

This attribute is a lambda function that maps the (temporal) length of the input acoustic features to the (temporal) length of the output softmax layer.  This function is used in the computation of CTC loss; to see this, look at the `add_ctc_loss` function in `train_utils.py`.  To see where the `output_length` attribute is defined for the models in the code, take a look at the `sample_models.py` file.  You will notice this line of code within most models:\n",
